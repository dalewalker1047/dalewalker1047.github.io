 Hello, I'm Dale Walker. I'm a student at Virginia Tech's College of Engineering working towards a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities and internships. I'm interested in software jobs however it would be a plus if they included some level of hardware, low code, or computer architecture.
