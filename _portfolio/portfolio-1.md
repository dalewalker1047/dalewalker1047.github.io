excerpt: "My team and I developed a prototype for a cooling system that would be implemented into data center server racks. My main contribution was creating the user interface as seen on the project poster, as well as, creating the Arduino code that takes in data from multiple temperature and flow sensors and then opens or closes the valves regulating the water flow.

My team and I developed a prototype for a system that would be implemented into data center server racks. The concept was to utilize industry-standard cooling methods and make them more efficient. In this case, we are taking water cooling and regulating the water to account for the load of the computers within the rack. My main contribution was creating the user interface as seen on the project poster, as well as, creating the Arduino code that takes in data from multiple temperature and flow sensors and then opens or closes the valves regulating the water flow. The user interface was created using PyQT5
