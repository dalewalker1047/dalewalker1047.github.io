title: "Pulse Oximeter"
excerpt: "My partner and I created a pulse oximeter that calculates the amount of oxygen in one's blood and heart rate. The parts given to us included a finger sensor, multiplexer, display, and Arduino. Using these parts we created 5 different filter stages that either amplified or processed the signal from the sensor. <br/><img src='/images/Display.png'> <br/><img src='/images/sensor2.png'> <br/><img src='/images/FilterPaths.png'>"
